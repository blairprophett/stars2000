          <h1>West Side Story</h1>
          <p>Book by  Arthur Laurents, Music by  Leonard Bernstein, Lyrics by  Stephen Sondheim</p>
          <p>Based on the conception of Jerome Robbins,  Based on Shakespeareâ€™s Romeo and Juliet.</p>
          <p>Young lovers are caught between prejudice and warring street gangs in this seminal retelling of Romeo and Juliet.</p>
          <p>From the first notes to the final breath, WEST SIDE STORY is one of the most memorable musicals and greatest love stories of all time.  Arthur Laurents' book remains as powerful, poignant and timely as ever.  The score by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim is widely regarded as one of the best ever written.  The world's greatest love story takes to the streets in this landmark Broadway musical that is one of the theatre's finest accomplishments.</p>
          <p>Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is transported to modern-day New York City, as two young idealistic lovers find themselves caught between warring street gangs, the â€œAmericanâ€ Jets and the Puerto Rican Sharks. Their struggle to survive in a world of hate, violence and prejudice is one of the most innovative, heart-wrenching and relevant musical dramas of our time.</p>

      <h2>What Our Actors Say!</h2>
      <div class="testimonials-info">
      <p><em>"STARS provided me with some of the most memorable summers of my life.  The connections I made and the hands-on training were undeniable.  I was given the opportunity to develop characters in full productions, which forced me to build a work ethic that has followed me to this day.  The act of "putting on a show" is a precious experience that can be very difficult to teach.  STARS does what no other teen program in the area can do.  The experienced instructors assemble a company of young individuals and provides them with the necessary guidance and resources.  What soon becomes apparent to every newcomer is that the entire ensemble must work together in order to make it to opening night."</em></p>
